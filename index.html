      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          The web is many computers that communicate with each other. When a person goes to a web page like www.yahoo.com, that persons computer sends a
          <span class="italic">HTTP Request</span> to a <span class="italic">server</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The server will find the necessary HTML document and it sends it back to the user's computer where a <span class="italic">
          web browser</span> interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen.

        <p>
          HTML documents contain <span class="italic">text

          <span class="italic">markup</span> which describes "how it looks".

          HTML documents are made of HTML
          <span class="bold">elements</span>. When writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML

        Are Computers actually Stupid?

      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          Computers are considered stupid because they interpret instructions. This makes them very unforgiving since a small mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems in a program.

        <p>
          HTML elements are either <span class="bold">inline</span> or <span class="bold">block</span>. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.

        The "tree-like structure" of HTML
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          The "tree-like structure" comes from the fact that HTML elements can have other elements inside of them. You can draw this relationship like a family tree.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a browser, this structure shows up as a series of nested boxes. There are boxes inside of boxes inside of boxes, and so on...

        What is the relationship between indented HTML and boxes??

      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          When someone reads an HTML document as
          <span class="italic">text</span>, you will see a wave of changing indentations going up and down the left side of the document. The more indented an element is, the more deeply nested its corresponding "box" is.

        Text Editors that can be used...
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          When writing code, programmers can use special text editors (Sublime Text + many others). These editors make the programmer's life much easier. For example, some text editors will automatically generate a closing HTML tags (which can help drastically
          save time).

              Avoid Repetition at all cost :-) 
            </div>
            <div class="concept-description">
              <p>
                Avoiding repetition is important for a variety of reasons. Avoiding Errors: Most of the time programmers don't avoid repetition, a lot of times  they have do the same thing over and over. This may mean copy and pasting certain style attributes into many HTML elements
                or rewriting the same code (sometimes with minor differences) over and over again. This can open up the door for more errors when a programmer decides to change something. If they don't dilligently make that same change everywhere the repeated code appears,
                problems will crop up.
